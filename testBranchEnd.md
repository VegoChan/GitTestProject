### So far I've learned how to checkout/pull/push between different branches


#### Fetch remote branch and merge it into (current)local branch 
- git pull [remote] [remote branch]

#### Fetch remote branch and merge it into (current and specified)local branch
- git pull [remote] [remote branch]:[local spcified branch]



#### Push local branch to remote branch in regardless of what current branch it is
- git push [remote] [local branch]:[remote branch]


### summary
The notation ':' means '->',that is,'a:b' means 'a->b',which is from a to b.
